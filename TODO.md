# Kabaddi Game Implementation TODO

## Core Game Structure
- [ ] Create main game page (src/app/page.tsx)
- [ ] Set up game types and interfaces (src/lib/gameTypes.ts)
- [ ] Create game engine core logic (src/lib/gameEngine.ts)
- [ ] Implement Kabaddi rules and scoring (src/lib/kabaddiRules.ts)

## Game Components
- [ ] Create main game controller (src/components/KabaddiGame.tsx)
- [ ] Build Canvas rendering engine (src/components/GameCanvas.tsx)
- [ ] Create UI overlay component (src/components/GameUI.tsx)
- [ ] Build on-screen controls (src/components/GameControls.tsx)
- [ ] Create start screen (src/components/StartScreen.tsx)
- [ ] Create game results screen (src/components/GameResults.tsx)

## Game Logic Implementation
- [ ] Implement AI defender logic (src/lib/aiLogic.ts)
- [ ] Create canvas utilities (src/lib/canvasUtils.ts)
- [ ] Add collision detection system
- [ ] Implement player movement and controls

## Game Features
- [ ] Add raid timer system (30 seconds)
- [ ] Implement crossing midline logic
- [ ] Create tagging/touch detection
- [ ] Add return-to-base mechanics
- [ ] Implement live scoring system

- [ ] Add on-screen virtual controls
- [ ] Style game UI overlay

## Image Processing (AUTOMATIC)
- [ ] **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) â†’ AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing

## Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Install required dependencies
- [ ] Build and test game functionality
- [ ] Test player controls (arrow keys + touch)
- [ ] Test AI defender behavior
- [ ] Validate scoring and timer systems
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] API testing with curl commands
- [ ] Final deployment and preview URL

## Post-Implementation
- [ ] Create README with game instructions
- [ ] Add performance optimizations
- [ ] Test across different devices
